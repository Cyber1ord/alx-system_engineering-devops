Postmortem: Apache Error Outage ( 0x17. Web stack debugging #3)

**Summary of Issue:**
Time frame: May 10, 2023, from 15:00 to 17:45 (UTC)
Impact: A massive 500 error circus ensued as our beloved Apache service lost its footing. The users' queries were abandoned due to internal server issues, leaving them hanging in anguish.
**Timetable:**
- 15:30 Fear mode activated! An army of HTTP 500 error messages was unleashed upon us by monitoring alerts that went haywire.
- Steps taken: In order to find the hidden perpetrator, our brave team set out on an exciting research, delving deeply into server metrics and log files as well as the mysterious world of Apache.
- Deceptive lines of inquiry: Clever database connections and naughty code gremlins were our first guesses. Unfortunately, the truth escaped us, and these routes ended in dead ends like a maze of illusion.
- Resolution: At the stroke of 17:45, victory was within reach! We unveiled the true villain - a mischievous typo lurking within the sacred Apache configuration file. With a swift correction and a sprinkle of puppet magic, the correct module was summoned, and Apache roared back to life, leaving the 500 errors in its dust.
**Root Cause and Resolution:**
The root cause of the Apache error outbreak was a wicked misconfiguration in the Apache configuration file. A single mischievous typo led to a faulty module loading, unleashing the dreaded 500 internal server errors upon innocent users. But fear not! We banished the gremlin responsible by:
- Correcting the typo in the Apache configuration file using the powerful enchantment of Puppet, ensuring the right module was summoned.
- Deploying the corrected configuration with grace and elegance.
- Restarting Apache, breathing new life into the service and restoring the sweet harmony of a functioning web stack.
**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
We will set out on a mission to strengthen our defences and improve our resilience in order to protect our web stack from future mischief:
1. The Search for Configuration Vigilance: Make it a monthly habit to go over important configuration files, such as Apache, in order to find hidden gremlins.- Task: Using magnifying glasses and sharp eyes, assemble a fellowship of engineers for the monthly configuration review.
2. Enchantment of Configuration Validation: To protect against misconfigurations, use validation spells prior to deployment.- Task: Before unleashing modifications on the world, enchant our deployment procedure with automatic checking of Apache configurations.
3. Battle-Tested Automated Guards: Protect our testing process by incorporating automated tests that have the ability to identify abnormalities in module loading.
- Task: Give automated tests for Apache setups as a holy present to our CI/CD pipeline.
4. Centralised Logging and Monitoring Oracle: Use the centralised logging and monitoring expertise to quickly identify and uncover hidden issues in the web stack.- Task: Improve our monitoring and logging systems to notify us when internal server issues disturb Apache's peace.
5. The Heroes' Training Ground hone our incident response techniques through consistent practice and instruction, giving each team member the weapons they need to overcome hardship.- Task: Plan quarterly training sessions for incident response, in which we will battle gremlins virtually and solve simulated problems.
By taking these steps, we will strengthen our web stack, protect it from errors, and stand
